Oil wells over time will develop bacteria which will eventually lead to corrosion and contamination of both water and the oil itself
The "toxicity" or "destruction" level is based on logarithmic conversion of the intial measurements of mg/L
This is a example shiny application to see whether or not, a particular reading of bacteria in a sample well is of concern or not
A log value of 6 or greater is generally considered to be of concern
